Playing semi-realistically but need some cash for a new highway? Just realized you're in dire need of several new firehouses, stat?

This program lets you grant yourself any amount of money unconditionally. Use it for whatever headcanon you have.

## Using CitiesSkylinesMoneyGrant

- 1.Double click CitiesSkylinesMoneyGrant.exe
- 2.If the console didn't show the correct money, try running it as admin. If it dosen't work, offsets may have to update. Please tell me in [Issues](https://github.com/M3351AN/CitiesSkylinesMoneyGrant/issues).
- 3.Type in how much money you want to be granted.
- 4.Press Enter & get money.
- 5.Build your city.

## Mod Compatibility

Technically this program won't conflict with any mods.

## The Future

I can see how some might think that makes the game less sandboxy and more guided, but IMO it makes it more realistic -- if my city desperately needs a new transit line or a new highway (e.g. in Boston, the Big Dig, GLX and Nanning Rail Transit Metro Line 1 2 3 4 5 are prime examples), the federal (or state, or whoever) government is usually gonna kick in some money to make it happen.

For now, though, the program lets you decide!
